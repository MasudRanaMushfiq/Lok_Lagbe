Perfect! Since you’ve uploaded all your code files, I can help you **analyze and summarize your app** fully. Here’s a detailed breakdown of your software based on the code you’ve shared so far:


## **1. App Name and Platform**

* **App Name (likely):** Lok Lagbe
* **Platforms:** Android (Expo / React Native), potentially iOS in the future
* **Framework:** React Native with Expo Router

---

## **2. App Purpose**

* A **task/job marketplace** where:

  * Users can **post tasks/work** they want done.
  * Other users can **accept or do tasks** in exchange for payment.
  * Ratings, reviews, and wallet balances are tracked for users.
* Features include:

  * Posting jobs
  * Accepting jobs
  * Ratings & reviews
  * Wallet and transaction management
  * Admin panel to manage users (verification, deletion)
  * Skill/progress tracking of users (accepted/posted works)

---

## **3. Firebase Integration**

You use Firebase services extensively:

1. **Authentication (Firebase Auth)**

   * Sign-in/sign-up
   * Login persistence using AsyncStorage (for React Native)
2. **Firestore (Database)**

   * Collections:

     * `users` → user profiles, ratings, accepted/posted works, wallet balance
     * `worked` → tasks/jobs posted
     * `notifications` → alerts for work acceptance
3. **Firebase Storage** (optional)

   * Currently not used; you can skip it if no file uploads.
4. **Wallet / Transactions**

   * Wallet balance is stored per user in Firestore
   * Transactions are stored as a subcollection under each user

---

## **4. Core Screens / Components**

Here’s a list of screens/components from your code:

| Screen             | Purpose                 | Key Features                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Index`            | Welcome screen          | Start button navigates to login                |
| `Login / Register` | Auth screens            | Firebase Auth login/signup                     |
| `Home / Tabs`      | Main app navigation     | Access to tasks, wallet, profile               |
| `RatingScreen`     | Rate a user after work  | Submit rating & review, updates Firestore      |
| `ViewUserScreen`   | View user profile       | Shows rating, works, skill progress            |
| `WalletScreen`     | Wallet and transactions | Shows balance and transaction list             |
| `WorkDetails`      | Detailed task view      | Accept work, updates Firestore & notifications |
| `ShowAllUsers`     | Admin screen            | Lists all users, toggle verified, delete user  |

---

## **5. UI / Design**

* **Colors**:

  * Primary: `#3a125d`
  * Secondary: `#e89d07`
  * Background: `#eceefc`
  * Text: `#544d4d`
* **Styling**:

  * Rounded buttons & cards
  * Cards for user/task info
  * Progress bars for skills
  * Star ratings displayed visually
* **Icons**: Uses **Ionicons** for stars, verified, and action icons

---

## **6. Admin Features**

* **Admin UID:** `"yarTXhiAlPdFJQyQhajZNeDaWIC2"` (hardcoded)
* Admin can:

  * Verify/unverify users
  * Delete users
* Non-admin users can only see verified status

---

## **7. Authentication & Persistence**

* Firebase Auth initialized with **AsyncStorage persistence**:

  ```ts
  import { initializeAuth, getReactNativePersistence } from "firebase/auth";
  import AsyncStorage from "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage";
  ```
* CurrentUser state is used in all screens to check login
* Persistent login works as long as Firebase Auth is correctly initialized

---

## **8. Data Handling**

* Firestore is queried in **every screen** where user or task data is needed
* Real-time updates **not implemented** (all fetches are one-time `getDoc` / `getDocs`)
* Ratings and reviews use `arrayUnion` to append new reviews
* Wallet updates reflect in `users` subcollection

---

## **9. Navigation**

* **Expo Router** is used:

  * `/auth/login`
  * `/home/(tabs)`
* Programmatic navigation via `router.push` or `router.replace`
* Route params used to pass IDs (e.g., `ratedUserId`, `workId`, `id`)

---

## **10. Possible Issues / Notes**

* Some features like Firebase Storage and notifications need full testing
* Admin UID is hardcoded → consider moving to Firestore-based role system
* Ratings and works update logic seems fine, but concurrency may need attention if multiple users rate/accept simultaneously
* No offline persistence for Firestore data (only login is persistent)

---

## **11. App Flow Summary**

1. User opens app → sees welcome screen → navigates to login
2. After login, user accesses tabs:

   * Browse jobs → see details → accept work
   * Complete work → rate user
   * Wallet → view balance & transactions
3. Admins can access all users → verify or delete users
4. Ratings, accepted/posted works, and skills are tracked
5. Notifications are stored in Firestore (no push yet)
